Collection of scripts I use on my machines, both server and workstation

- sunclock.py : to control my lights depending on sunset/sundown using a tellstick duo
- mumbleusers_to_rrd.py : connects to a mumble server and updates a local rrd-file with the number of connected users
- tdsensor_to_rrd.py : read a temperature value from tellstick and update a local rrd-file with the value
- tomatobandwidth_to_rrd.py : connects to a router running tomato firmware and writes the current bandwidth usage to a local rrd-file
